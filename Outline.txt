What do we actually want to do with our dashboard?

What all do we need to keep track of?
 - Bank Balances 
 - Bank Interest Rates
 - Indian Share holdings + Prices
 - Mutual Fund units Balances + NAV's
 - PPF holdings + Interest Rates
 - Gold Prices/Gm and gm/s u hold + goes up by 200RS daily
 - Us stocks + Prices
 - Less any credit card statements Generated and reduce their Balances from the networth

What features do we need?
> Prices refresh automatically (at least for shares)
> Fetch holdings if possible
> Daily net-worth number and a graph tracking it on a daily basis
> Py-chart showing allocation\

For the future:
# If your networth moves by 2% plus, you get a telegram message
# If it hits new high, you get a telegram message.
